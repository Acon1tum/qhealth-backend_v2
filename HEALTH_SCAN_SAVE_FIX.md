# Health Scan Save Fix

## Issue
Face scan results from the `@face-scan/` and `@health-report-display/` components were not being saved to the `HealthScan` model in the database.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing scanResults Parameter**: The frontend was not sending the `scanResults` parameter that the backend expected
2. **Incomplete Data Mapping**: Some health metrics were not being properly mapped from the frontend format to the backend database schema
3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Limited debugging information made it difficult to identify save failures
4. **Missing Validation**: Backend didn't validate required data before attempting to save

## Fixes Applied

### Frontend Changes (`quanby-healthcare_v2/src/app/services/health-scan.service.ts`)

1. **Added scanResults to Request**: Modified `saveFaceScanResults()` to include the original `scanResults` array in the request payload
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added more detailed logging to track the save process

```typescript
const request = {
  healthData,
  scanResults, // ← Added this missing parameter
  scanType: 'face-scan',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  notes: 'Face scan health assessment performed using AI facial analysis'
};
```

### Frontend Changes (`quanby-healthcare_v2/src/app/face-scan/face-scan.component.ts`)

1. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Added detailed error logging to help diagnose save failures
2. **Better Debug Information**: Added logging for scan results, user data, and authentication status

### Backend Changes (`qhealth-backend_v2/src/modules/self-check/self-check.controller.ts`)

1. **Added Data Validation**: Added validation to ensure `healthData` and `scanResults` are provided
2. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for the save process
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and status codes

```typescript
// Validate required data
if (!healthData || Object.keys(healthData).length === 0) {
  console.error('❌ No health data provided');
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Health data is required'
  });
}

if (!scanResults || scanResults.length === 0) {
  console.error('❌ No scan results provided');
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Scan results are required'
  });
}
```

### Backend Changes (`qhealth-backend_v2/src/modules/self-check/self-check.routes.ts`)

1. **Added Test Endpoint**: Added `/test-db` endpoint to verify database connectivity

## Data Mapping

The frontend maps face scan results to the following HealthScan model fields:

| Frontend Category | Backend Field | Description |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `heartRate` | `heartRate` | Heart rate in bpm |
| `systolicPressure` | `bloodPressure` (systolic part) | Systolic blood pressure |
| `diastolicPressure` | `bloodPressure` (diastolic part) | Diastolic blood pressure |
| `oxygenSaturation` | `spO2` | Oxygen saturation percentage |
| `respiratoryRate` | `respiratoryRate` | Respiratory rate in bpm |
| `stress`/`stressLevel` | `stressLevel` | Stress level score |
| `stressScore` | `stressScore` | Composite stress score |
| `hrvSdnn` | `hrvSdnn` | HRV SDNN value |
| `hrvRmssd` | `hrvRmsdd` | HRV RMSSD value |
| `overall` | `generalWellness` | Overall wellness score |
| `coronaryRisk` | `coronaryHeartDisease` | Coronary heart disease risk (converted to decimal) |
| `heartFailureRisk` | `congestiveHeartFailure` | Heart failure risk (converted to decimal) |
| `strokeRisk` | `strokeRisk` | Stroke risk (converted to decimal) |
| `cvdRisk`/`generalRisk` | `generalRisk` | General cardiovascular risk (converted to decimal) |
| `intermittentClaudication` | `intermittentClaudication` | Intermittent claudication risk (converted to decimal) |
| `covidRisk` | `covidRisk` | COVID-19 risk (converted to decimal) |

## Testing

1. **Database Connection Test**: Use the new `/api/self-check/test-db` endpoint
2. **Health Scan Save Test**: Use the provided `test-health-scan-save.js` script
3. **Frontend Testing**: Perform a face scan and monitor console logs for save attempts

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. Face scan results are properly mapped to HealthScan model fields
2. A consultation record is created for the self-check
3. A HealthScan record is created with all the mapped health data
4. A medical history record is created documenting the scan
5. Success/error messages are displayed to the user
6. Comprehensive logging helps with debugging
