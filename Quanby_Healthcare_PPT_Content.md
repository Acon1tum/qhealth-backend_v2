## Slide 4: Key Features - Advanced AI Technology
**üî¨ AI-Powered Health Assessment**

Our AI technology acts as a health assistant that can monitor your health through facial analysis. The system watches your face through the camera and can determine how you're feeling, how fast your heart is beating, and even how stressed you might be - all just by looking at you naturally during a conversation. It uses smart computer technology that learns to understand your unique health patterns. The AI can pick up subtle changes in your face that show stress, track your heart rate by watching the color changes in your skin, and even measure your breathing rate - all while you're just talking normally. It works during your video calls with your doctor, so they can see your health information in real-time without interrupting your conversation. It's like having a health monitor that's always watching and learning about you, helping you and your doctor understand your health better.

---

## Slide 5: Key Features - Video Consultation
**üé• Integrated Video Consultation**

Our video consultation feature lets you talk to your doctor in HD video with the ability to check your vital signs during the call. When your doctor needs to check your health metrics, they can manually start a face scan that analyzes your heart rate, stress levels, and other health information. The results are displayed on both your screen and your doctor's screen, so you can both see the health data together - it's like having a health monitor built right into your video call. You can share your medical records, test results, and other important documents right on the screen, making it easy for your doctor to see everything they need to help you. The system lets multiple doctors join the same call if you need a second opinion or specialist care. If you ever have an emergency, the system can connect you quickly with priority access, giving you and your doctor immediate health information when time matters.

---

## Slide 6: Key Features - Health Baseline Management
**üìà Health Baseline Management**

Your health baseline is like your personal health fingerprint - it's unique to you and helps us understand what's normal for your body. Our system learns about your health by tracking all your health information over time, creating a personal health profile that's just for you. Instead of comparing you to everyone else, we compare you to yourself - your own normal heart rate, your own normal stress levels, your own normal everything. This means when something changes, we can tell right away because we know what's normal for you specifically. The system watches for patterns and trends in your health, so if something starts to change slowly over time, we can catch it early before it becomes a problem. Your doctor can see how your current health compares to your personal baseline and your health history, giving them a complete picture of your health journey. The system will send you alerts if something changes significantly from your normal patterns, helping you and your doctor stay on top of your health and catch any issues early when they're easier to treat.

---

## Slide 7: Health Metrics - Cardiovascular System
**üíì Cardiovascular Health Monitoring**

Your heart is the most important muscle in your body, and our system helps keep it healthy by monitoring all the important heart health information. We can check your heart rate (how fast your heart beats - usually 60-100 times per minute for healthy adults), your blood pressure (the pressure of blood flowing through your arteries - normally around 120/80), and even assess your risk for heart problems. The system can do all this just by looking at your face - no uncomfortable blood pressure cuffs or sticky heart monitor pads needed. The system can tell if your heart is beating normally or if there might be any rhythm problems, and it can even assess your risk for serious heart conditions like heart attacks, heart failure, or strokes. This helps you and your doctor catch any heart health issues early when they're much easier to treat and manage. It's like having a heart specialist watching over you during every check-up, making sure your heart stays healthy and strong.

---

## Slide 8: Health Metrics - Additional Systems
**ü´Å Respiratory & Advanced Metrics**

Our system doesn't just check your heart - it provides a complete health checkup that looks at everything. We can monitor how you're breathing (usually 12-20 breaths per minute for healthy adults), check how much oxygen is in your blood (normally 95-100%), and even see how stressed you might be feeling. The system can pick up on subtle changes in your face that show stress, anxiety, or other emotional states, helping your doctor understand not just your physical health but your mental wellbeing too. We also measure something called heart rate variability, which tells us how well your body can handle stress and recover from challenges - it's like checking how resilient your body is. All of this information comes together to give you an overall health score from 0-100%, making it easy to see how you're doing at a glance. The system can learn a lot about your health just by looking at your face - it's like having a whole team of health specialists working together to keep you healthy.

---

## Slide 9: Self-Check System Workflow
**üöÄ How Self-Check Works**

Using our self-check feature is easy and only takes a few minutes. First, you go to the self-check section on our platform, and the system will help you get everything set up properly. It checks your camera to make sure it's working, gives you tips on the best lighting, and helps you sit about 2-3 feet from the camera for the best results. The system is smart about making sure you're in the right position and have good lighting - it's like having a helpful assistant guiding you through the whole process. Once you're all set up, you just look at the camera and stay still for about 30-60 seconds while our AI analyzes your health. The system automatically finds your face and starts analyzing all the health information it can see - your heart rate, stress levels, breathing, and more. The whole thing happens in the background while you just sit comfortably, and before you know it, you'll have a complete health report. It's designed to be simple and non-invasive, so you can do it anytime from the comfort of your own home.

---

## Slide 10: Self-Check Results & Management
**üìä Results Review & Data Management**

After your self-check, you'll get an easy-to-understand health report that shows you exactly how you're doing. The system gives you an overall health score that's like a quick health grade, plus it breaks down all your health information into easy categories like heart health, breathing, stress levels, and more. Everything is color-coded so you can see at a glance what's great (green), what's good (orange), and what might need attention (red). Each health measurement comes with simple explanations so you understand what it means and why it matters for your health. All your health information is automatically saved to your personal profile, so you can see how your health changes over time and track your progress. You can compare your current results with previous check-ups to see if you're getting healthier, and you can even download your health report or email it to your doctor. The system can also remind you when it's time for your next health check, and if anything looks like it needs attention, it can help you schedule an appointment with your doctor right away.

## Slide 11: Video Consultation Process
**üé• Doctor-Patient Video Consultations**

The video consultation process begins with a streamlined appointment scheduling system that allows patients to book consultations directly through the platform, selecting from available time slots and healthcare providers. Prior to the consultation, patients complete a comprehensive pre-consultation health questionnaire that provides healthcare providers with essential background information and current health concerns. The system performs automatic technical setup verification to ensure optimal video quality and health monitoring capabilities, checking camera functionality, internet connectivity, and audio quality to guarantee a smooth consultation experience.

During the consultation, patients engage in high-definition video calls with their healthcare providers while the system simultaneously performs AI-powered real-time health monitoring. This dual functionality enables healthcare providers to conduct natural medical conversations while receiving continuous updates on vital signs, stress levels, and other health metrics. The platform displays live health data to both parties, creating a collaborative environment where patients can see their health metrics in real-time while healthcare providers use this information to make informed clinical decisions.

The consultation experience is enhanced by the system's ability to provide historical and baseline data comparison, allowing healthcare providers to view current health readings in the context of previous assessments and established health baselines. This comprehensive view enables more accurate diagnosis, better treatment planning, and more effective monitoring of treatment progress. The integration of real-time health monitoring with traditional consultation practices creates a new standard for telemedicine that combines the convenience of remote care with the clinical insight of continuous health monitoring.

## Slide 13: Health Baseline Management
**üìà Establishing & Using Health Baselines**

The establishment of health baselines represents a fundamental component of our personalized healthcare approach, beginning with an initial comprehensive health evaluation that captures each patient's unique physiological patterns and health status. This process involves conducting multiple measurements over time to ensure accuracy and account for natural variations in health metrics. The system employs sophisticated algorithms to calculate personal baseline values that are specific to each individual, moving beyond generic population-based standards to create truly personalized health benchmarks.

The baseline establishment process includes doctor review and validation to ensure clinical accuracy and appropriateness of the established baselines. Healthcare providers can review the calculated baseline values, adjust them based on clinical knowledge and patient history, and validate the appropriateness of the established thresholds for each individual patient. This collaborative approach between AI technology and clinical expertise ensures that baseline values are both scientifically accurate and clinically relevant.

Our baseline components encompass comprehensive health metrics including vital signs baselines for heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate that are personalized to each individual's normal ranges. Cardiovascular risk baselines establish personal risk thresholds that account for individual factors such as age, gender, family history, and lifestyle factors. Stress level baselines capture individual stress response patterns and normal stress ranges, while overall health score baselines provide personal benchmarks for general wellness assessment. The system also performs continuous trend analysis to monitor historical progression and identify long-term health patterns that inform baseline adjustments and treatment planning.
